Framework is called GREETR

GREETR helps give greetings, example...on a website, when user logins, the user is greeted in whatever language they choose in the dropdown menu.

When given a first name, last name, and optional language, it generates formal and informal greetings.

Supports English and Spanish for starters.

This code is reusable.

Easy to type 'G$()' structure, very similar to jQuery.

GREETR also supports jQuery. 

GREETR can be given a jQuery object that points at some html element and then fill that element with the greeting.
